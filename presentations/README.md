**Abstract**: We propose a new foundational theory of cybersecurity (see our paper "[On Etiology of Cybersecurity](../reports/paper_0)" for more details), introduce [V-Research](http://v-research.it) and the [Purple Challenge](link-to-challenge).
We apply our cybersecurity theory for the precise security risk estimation of cyber-physical systems.
