## (presentation 0) Cybersecurity Theory and Risk Assessment Application

**Authors**: The Science Club [@V-Research](http://v-research.it)

**Abstract**: We propose a new foundational theory of cybersecurity (see our
paper "[On Etiology of Cybersecurity](../reports/paper_0)" for more details)
and we show how to apply our cybersecurity theory for the
precise security risk estimation of cyber-physical systems.
