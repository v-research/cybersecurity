### (presentation 0) Cybersecurity Theory and Security Risk Assessment Application
In [presentation_0.odp](./presentation_0.odp) we
propose a new foundational theory of cybersecurity,
introduce [V-Research](http://v-research.it) and the [Purple Challenge](link-to-challenge).
We apply our cybersecurity theory for the precise security risk estimation of cyber-physical systems.
