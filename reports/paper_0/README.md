**Authors**: The Science Club [@V-Research](http://v-research.it) (knowledgezero@v-research.it)

**Abstract**: The objective of this research is to lay the foundations for the development of a scientific theory that determines
(all and only) the possible insecure and secure configurations of
any abstract system. We claim that cybersecurity weaknesses
(i.e. errors) are at the beginning of the causality chain that
leads to cybersecurity attacks. We, then, formulate a scientific
(falsifiable by experiments) hypothesis that we use to predict
all the weaknesses in the architectural design of an abstract
system. The mathematical formulation of our hypothesis is
based on a correlation between the epistemological concepts of
facts, beliefs, and assertions with the engineering concepts of
requirements, functional architectures, and channels. Ultimately,
our hypothesis allows for the definition of a mathematical formula
which describes the cybersecurity of a system. We implemented
a prototype cybersecurity risk assessment tool that, based on
our hypothesis, predicts
