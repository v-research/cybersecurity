## (paper 0) The Etiology of Cybersecurity 

**Authors**: The Science Club [@V-Research](http://v-research.it) (knowledgezero@v-research.it)

**Abstract**: 
The objective of this research is to lay the foundations for
the development of a scientic theory that determines (all and only) the
possible insecure and secure congurations of any abstract system to
be used for the risk assessment of systems. We claim that cybersecurity
weaknesses (i.e. errors) are at the beginning of the causality chain that
leads to cybersecurity attacks. We formulate a hypothesis that we use
to predict the weaknesses in the architectural design of an system. Our
hypothesis allows for the denition of a mathematical formula which
describes the cybersecurity of a system. We implemented a prototype
cybersecurity risk assessment tool that, based on our hypothesis, predicts
the weaknesses in a UML model of a (cyber-physical) system.
