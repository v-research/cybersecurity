\begin{enumerate}[start=1, label={req\arabic*)}]
	\item the tank has no functional architecture, it is a purely physical component which has the only purpose of containing water
	\item the communication is unidirectional from the tank to the input port of the sensor
	\item the sensor has an input-port that receives only incoming communication from the tank
	\item the sensor has two functional blocks
		\begin{enumerate}[label={req4.\arabic*)}]
			\item read\_water\_level, accepts inputs only from the input-port and outputs a new reading every $t$ seconds
			\item comm\_water\_level, accepts inputs only from the read\_water\_level and communicates the readings to the output-port
		\end{enumerate}
	\item the sensor has an output-port that only outputs the messages generated by the comm\_water\_level to the input-port of the controller
	\item the controller has in input-port that only receives incoming communications from the sensor and sends the messages to the functional architecture
	\item the functional architecture of the controller is composed by three functional blocks
		\begin{enumerate}[label={req7.\arabic*)}]
			\item get\_water\_level, accepts inputs only from the input-port and outputs the water level to the main control function
			\item control, calculate the next state of the valve based on the inputs receive from the get\_water\_level
			\item send\_state, receives the output of the control function and communicates it to the output-port
		\end{enumerate}
	\item the controller has an output-port that only outputs the messages generated by the send\_state to the input-port of the actuator 
	\item the actuator has an input-port that receives only incoming communication from the controller 
	\item the functional architecture of the actuator is composed by two functional blocks
		\begin{enumerate}[label={req10.\arabic*)}]
			\item read\_change\_state, accepts inputs only from the input-port and outputs the next state of the valve to the close\_open\_valve function
			\item close\_open\_valve, converts the digital next state received from the read\_change\_state an analog signal and communicates it the output-port
		\end{enumerate}
	\item the valve accepts analog messages from the output port of the actuator and changes its state based on those messages
\end{enumerate}
