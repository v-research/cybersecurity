## Research and Development for Cybersecurity Engineering
This is the public repository of the cybersecurity research initiative of [V-Research](http://v-research.it).
As V-Research we believe in freedom and openness. 
We want to share our results, fostering collaborations rather than competition.
We hope that by sharing our research prototypes and reports we'll be able to make the world a secure place :)

Our research initiative is driven by the [Purple Challenge](https://www.v-research.it/globalpurplechallenge), in which we want to 
showcase a 100% secure cyber-physical system. The challenge is bold and ambitious but
we believe that a scientific approach should aim at something precise and rigorous. 
There is no more-or-less in science, either you have a theory that precisely predicts
some phenomenon or you keep searching for that theory. In fact, the first journey
we have undertaken is towards the definition of a ([currently missing](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/herley)) scientific theory of cybersecurity.
We now live in a world where (pen)testing is the main weapon against cybersecurity attacks.
But, if there is no cybersecurity theory, what are we testing? We believe a more scientific 
approach will stem from a secure-by-design approach and this is how we started.
This is our educated guess but "there is no royal road to science"; if you have other ideas and you 
want to share them with us, feel free to drop us an email (knowledgezero@v-research.it)

This repository is currently structured into the following sections
- [presentations](./presentations), where we share the slides related to our cybersecurity initiative (under [CC-SA license](./presentations/LICENSE.md))
- [reports](./reports), where we share our papers and pre-prints (mostly under [CC-SA license](./presentations/LICENSE.md))
- [prototypes](./prototypes), where we share our prototypes under the [AGPLv3 license](./prototypes/LICENSE.md)
