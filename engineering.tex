\subsubsection{Relevant Standards}\label{sec:standards}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item DO-326A
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item specification -- definition of the desired design of a system. The
specification is verified w.r.t. the  $\abf$ theory. Checking the
controls of the whole cybersecurity life-cycle and the relation with
CWE.
\item design -- the mitigations identified in the specification stage
are implemented into the design. The security of the assets w.r.t. the design are
verified with a, so called, cybersecurity risk assessment.
\end{enumerate}
